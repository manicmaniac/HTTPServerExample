HTTPServerExample
=================

An example pure-Swift implementation of HTTPServer based on CoreFoundation and CFNetwork.

Features
--------

- Simple and fast: less than 150 lines of code in core implementation.
- Flexibility: most of HTTP 1.1 feature is supported due to its primitiveness.
- Event-Driven: runs only on the single thread but capable of multi-clients.
